# This project has dependencies

- In order to get started,, you will need to manually install Node (^6.11), and Yarn
-- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - If you haven't used it before, Yarn is the successor for Browserify
- Once those have been installed, navigate to this directory and run `$ yarn install` from your shell (terminal, powershell, whatever).
- You can now run `$ node server.js` (again from your shell) and the server will start running.
