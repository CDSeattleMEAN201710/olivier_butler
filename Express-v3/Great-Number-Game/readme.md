# The Great Number Game

Just another guessing game, but with sass. This one was written as an Angular app, no styling.

## This project has dependencies

- In order to get started, you will need to manually install Node (^6.11), and Yarn
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) [Optional] - If you haven't used it before, Yarn is the successor for Browserify and works with NPM
- Once those have been installed, navigate to this directory and run `$ yarn install` from your shell (terminal, powershell, whatever).
- You can now run `$ node server.js` (again from your shell) and the server will start running.
