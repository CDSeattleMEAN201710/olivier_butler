    A scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a stream and the 
    scorpion asks the frog to carry him across on its back. The 
    frog asks, "How do I know you won't sting me?" The scorpion 
    says, "Because if I do, I will die too."
</p>
<p>
    The frog is satisfied, and they set out, but in midstream,
    the scorpion stings the frog. The frog feels the onset of 
    paralysis and starts to sink, knowing they both will drown,
    but has just enough time to gasp "Why?"
